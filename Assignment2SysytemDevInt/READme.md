## Caution

---

Some things we didn't do, we did not have the Main recieve any argument from the command line, as I kept on having java.lang.ClassNotFoundException error when I try to complie from the terminal.

So to run the program, please run it using the execute button on intelli J, first running the SeverFileShare.java main function, then running Main.java main function, if you need to change the directory of where the client's folder will be, you can change it in the Main.java main function.
